<h2 id="intro">KLIMU Alert System</h2>

---

KlimuBot is an intelligent service that sends weather and geological alerts by different channels of communication. Its objective is to minimise the consequences of adverse weather events on the population to achieve the greatest social welfare.

The alerts can be configured from a website to be received by different media and in a personalised way. In addition, for geological alerts, artificial intelligence is used to classify the degree of possible earthquakes.

KLIMU has been designed with the idea of the users being able to manage all the different aspects of the application from a single place. To achive that, a web application has been designed and implemented. This application can be found at https://klimu.eus.

KLIMU is indirectly aligned with two Sustainable Development Goals.

- **Sustainable Development Goal Nº3**: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
